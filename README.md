# DotMatrix

A JavaScript tool for making dynamic replicas of dot-matrix highway signs.

Not too long ago, I had to drive home alone from my parents' place in Virginia, a ten-hour trip under the best of circumstances. As the hours ticked by and the road just kept stretching out in front of me, the electronic highway signs caught my eye, and a thought struck me...

_"I bet that would be really easy to do for the web._

And thus, DotMatrix was born: a script to render messages in the style of those road signs. It's still in its early stages, but it's coming along nicely.
